# WipeOut
Cleaning Same Pictures/Files on the selected directory

The programme do some cleaning work for same pictures (or files for now - but it'll be change soon cause I want only pics)
which has been saved on harddrive twice or more.
You have to pick a directory using JavaFileChooser and programme are listing all file in the directory.
When you click to "find and clean pictures/files" button, it wipes the same pictures/files and one of them remains.
Its easy and fast.
You can wipe your wife's or children's pictures 
which is cool cause no one wants to see or save any pictures twice.
